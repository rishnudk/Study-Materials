Second Domain Week

JavaScript

1. What is JS?

- High level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites
- Client side language
- Interpreted language
- Lightweight and flexible
- Event-driven and asynchronous
- Object oriented and functional

2. How javascript runs

- Javascript engine - V8, Spidermonkey, Javascript core
- What the engine does
	- Parses the code
	- Compiles it to machine code using JIT compilation
	- Executes the code
- Javascript in the browser - like V8 in the chrome
- Web apis - not part of JS engine, but provided by the browser - DOM, setTimeout, fetch, console ect.

3. Variable

- Labelled box where you store some value
- 3 ways to create variable - var, let, const
	- var - function scope
	- let - block scope
	- const - block scope

4. Data types

Primitive data types
- Basic, immutable data types
- String, number, boolean, undefined, null, bigint

Non-primitive data types
- Store multiple values and are mutable
- Object, array, function

typeof Operator
- To check the type of variable

5. Type conversion vs Type coercion

Where values change from one datatype to another, either manually or automatically

Type conversion
- Explicitily converting using functions
- Explicit conversion - toString, parseInt, Number, Boolean

Type coercion
- JS automatically converts
- Implicit type conversion

6. Operators

Arithmetic operators
- Used for basic math
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, Division ect.

Assignment operator
- Used to assign values
- Assign, +=, -+ ect.

Comparison operator
- Used to compare values
- ==, ===, !=, >, < ect.

Logical operator
- Used for logical operations
- &&, !

String operator
- Used to concate strings
- +

Ternery operator
- Compact way of writing if else
- ? :

Type operator
- Used to check the type of
- typeof, instanceof

7. Conditional statements

if statement
- Executes a block if the condition is true

if-else statement
- It true do this else do this

if-else if-else statement
- Use when multiple cases

switch statement
- Checking one variable against many values

8. Loops

for loop
- When you know how many times to loop

while loop
- runs when a condition is true

do-while loop
- Run atleast one even if the condition is false

for-of loop
- used for arrays, strings ect

for-in loop
- used in objects

9. Functions

Function declaration

Function with parameters

Function with return value

Function expression
- Function stored in variables

Arrow function
- Short way of writing functions

Default parameters

Rest parameters
- Used to accept multiple arguments as an array

Callback functions
- Passing an function as an argument to another function

Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
- Function calls itself when declared

10. Arrays

Array methods
- push() - Insert an element at the end
- pop() - Remove the last element
- unshift() - Adds at start
- shift() - Removes the first element
- includes() - Check existence
- indexOf() - find index
- join() - Convert array to string by adding an element between
- slice() - copy a portion
- splice() - Add/Remove/Replace
- reverse() - Reverse the array
- sort() - Sort the elements in a order
- forEach() - loops through item
- map() - Returns a new array after iterating through the existing array
- filter() - Returns items that matches a condition
- find() - Get the first matching value
- findIndex() - Get the index of first matching value
- reduce() - Combine all values to one
- every() - Check if all items match condition
- some() - Check if any item matched condition
- fill() - Fill array with value
- flat() - Flatten nested array

11. Objects

An object is a collection of key-value pairs

Nested objects
- Object inside objects

Accessing and modifying objects
- Dot notation
- Bracket notation

Methods
- Object.keys(obj) - Gives array of keys
- Object.values(obj) - Gives values of obj
- Object.entries(obj) - Array of [key, value] pairs

12. ES6 features

let and const

Arrow functions

Template literals

Destructuring

Default parameters

Rest parameters

Spread operator

Modules

Classes

for-of loop

Map and Set

Promises

Symbol

Block scoping with let and const

13. DOM Manipulation

DOM is the structure of your html page represented in javascript as tree of objects

Accessing Dom elements
- getElementById
- getElementsByClassName
- getElementsByTagName
- querySelector
- querySelectorAll

Changing content
- innerText
- innerHTML

Changing styles
- style.color

Adding and removing class
- classlist.add
- classlist.remove

Creating a new element	
- document.createElement

Remove elements
- element.remove()

Event and eventListners
- .addEventListner

Event delegation
- Adding a single event listner to parent object instead of attaching to child elements

Event object
- When an event happens, an event object is automatically passed to your handler. It contains info like what was clicked, mouse/key data, preventing default behaviour

14. Date methods

Buid in method
- Date.now()

15. Error handling

What is error handling
- How javascript catches runtime errors without crashing the application
- Using try..catch block

Finally block
- Always runs, whether error or not

Throwing custom errors
- You can throw custom errors using throw

16. Set and Map

Set 
- A collection of unique values
- Methods
	- add(value)
	- delete(value)
	- has(value)
	- clear()
	- size

Looping through set
- for(let item of set)

Map
- Collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type
- Methods
	- set(key, value)
	- get(key)
	- has(key)
	- delete(key)
	- clear()
	- size

17. JSON

JSON stands for Javascript object notation, lightweight format for storing and transfering data, mostly used in web APIs and web apps

JSON.stringify()
- Converts JS objects to strings

JSON.parse()
- Converts JSON string to js objects

18. Hoisting

Javascript behaviour of moving declared functions, variables to the top during their compilation phase

2 phases in javasript
- Memory allocation phase
- Execution phase

Let and Const get hoisted
- Gets stored in the memory during memory allocation phase but doest get initialized

Var gets hoisted
- Allocates in the memory and initializes with the value undefined

Temporal dead zone
- The space between hoisting and the actual line of declaration of the code. Let and Const will get refernce error while var becomes undefined

19. Closure

A function remebers the variable from outer scope even if the function has stopper working

20. Scope

Global Scope
- Variables declared outside the function
- Accessible anywhere

Functional scope
- Variables declared inside a function
- Only accessible to that function

Block Scope
- let and const
- Only available inside the {} declared

Scope chain
- When trying to access a variable JS looks into
- Current scope
- outer scope
- global scope

21. Execution context

Environment where js code is evaluated and executed. Every time a code is invoked, a new execution context is created

Types
- Global execution context
- Function execution context
- Eval execution context

Phases of context
- Creation phase
	- Memory allocated
	- var hoisted alloted to undefined
	- let and const hoisted in the tdz
	- functions are hoisted fully
- Execution phase
	- Code is executed line by line
	- Variables are assigned values
	- functions are invoked

22. Call stack

JS is single threaded so it uses call stack to manage execution

When call stack is empty, program ends

Stack overflow
- When you have nested calls without termination

23. Single and multi

Single threaded
- One line runs at a time in a single main thread

Multi threaded
- Run multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple threads

24. this keyword

this refers to the object that is executing the current function

Different scenarois
- Global context - window object(in browsers) - global object(in node.js)
- Function - global object
- Inside a method - The parent object
- Arrow functions - Dont have their own this. They take this from the lexical scope
- Constructor function - this refers to newly created object
- Event listners - this refers to the element that trigerred the listner

25. Prototype 

In js every object has a internal link to another object called prototype. 

When you try to access the property on an object, JS checks the object itself, and if not found check its prototype and then prototype's prototype and continues

26. Class and OOPS in js

OOP is a programming style based on the concept of objects - like blueprint that produce real items

Class and contructor
- Class - defines the blueprint
- constructor - initialize properties

Super keyword
- Used to call the method or constructor of the parent class

Encapsulation
- Making methods or values private, protected or public

Polymorphism

27. Callback

Function passed as an argument to another function to handle async results

Callback hell
- Calling nested function inside a single function

Promise
- Object that represents a value that is available in the future

Promise chanining
- Chaining promises using then and catch

Async/Await
- Syntax sugar for promise

28. Asynchronous javascript

JS is single threaded, but works asynchronously using event loop

setTimeout and setInterval
- Doesnt block the code, runs in the background

Callbacks

Promises
- Promise.resolve - returns a resolved value
- Promise.reject - returns a rejected promise
- Promise.all - wait for all promises to resolve, if any fails it rejects
- Promise.allSettled - wait for all promises to finish. Never rejects	
- Promise.race - Returns the first settled promise
- Promise.any - Returns tha first fullfilled promise. If all rejects, throws an aggregate error

29. Ajax and Fetch

AJAX - Asynchronous javascript and xml
- Technique not a language
- Used to read and write without refreshing the page

Old way - using XMLHttpRequest

Fetch api
- Modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest
- Promise based

30. Storage

Local Storage
- Store in browser
- No expiration
- Data is per origin
- Accessible via local storage

Session storage
- Data last only till the browser closes

Cookie Storage
- Store small amount of data (<4kb)
- Can set an expiry date
- Automatically sent to server with each request

31. Debouncing and Throttling

Debouncing
- Waits for user to stop executing a function
- Only runs a function after a delay and if no event is trigerred in between

Throttling
- Funcitons works at least x times in a specific time interval unless how many times trigerred

32. Memory allocation

How js allocates and frees memory when things are created

Memory allocation has 2 phases
- Allocation phase
	- When objects, variables ect are created
- Deallocation
	- When data is no longer needed, reclaims the memory

33. Garbage collection

How javascript manages memory. Automated process of javascript of removing unwanted objects not in use(unreachable)

Reachability
- If an object is reachable, its in use. If not, its garbage

Reachable means
- Its in the call stack
- Reffered from the global variable
- Reffered from another reachable object

Mark and Sweep algorithm
- Mark phase - Start from the root and mark all the objects which can be reached and mark it
- Sweep phase - Remove all the unmarked objects

Memory leak
- When an app retains memory but dont need it. Still holds references, gargabe collector cant remove it

Causes
- Global variables
- Uncleared timer and intervals
- Detached dom elements
- Closures holding large data

Detecting memory leaks
- Devtools -> Memory tab
- Take a heap snapshot

34. Regular expression

A regex is sequence of characters that form a search pattern

35. Currying

Process of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions where each take one argument

36. Event bubbling and Capturing

The event follows a three phase journey
- Capturing phase - Event travels from the window to the target element
- Target phase - Event reaches the target element
- Bubbling phase - Event bubbles back from the target element to the window



--------------- EXTRAS ----------------



1. Order of parsing
- How js reads your code from top to bottom before running it. There are two phases for this

Parsing phase
- JS reads you code
- Allocates memory for variables and funcitons
- Process function declaration and variable declaration
- Hoisting happens

Execution phase
- Executes code line by line
- Variables assigned, functions called

2. Proxy
- Lets you intercept and redefine operations on a object like property access, assignment, deletion ect
- It acts like a middleman

3. Mutation observer
- Browser API that checks for changes in the dom, like
- New elements added
- Text updated
- Attributes chaged
- Elements removed
- When such changes happen, a callback function is triggered

4. Starvation
- When microtask gets accumulated in the microtask queue, task queue or callback queue doesnt get a chance to run. 
- This is called starvation

5. JIT compilation
- Makes your code run faster
- Interprets each line of you code
- Frequently used code is turned into machine code
- JS is both interpreted and compiled

Phases of JIT
- Parsing - Code -> Abstract syntax tree
- Interpreter - Convert AST -> bytecode
- Profiler - Watched which code runs frequently
- Compiler - Optimized hot code to machine code

Abstract syntax tree
- Tree like structure of the source code that is easier for js to understand and manipulate

Helps in 
- Code optimization
- Syntax checking
- Transpilation	

6. Higher order functions
- Either takes a function as a argument
- Or returns a function
- Or both

7. Decorator function
- Wrapper around another function which enhances the functionalities of the inner function

8. WeakSet
- Similar to set
- Stores only objects
- Weakly stored, doesnt prevent garbage collection
- Not iterable

9. WeakMap
- Keys must be objects
- Cant iterate
- Held weakly

10. Flatmap
- Performs .map along with .flat(1) in one step

11. copyWithin
- Copies part of the array to another location in the same array, replacing values

12. Unary operator
- Operators which work only on one operand 
- Unary operator takes one value and performs actions on it

13. Shadowing
- Variable declared in the inner scope has the same name as one declared in the outer scope
- The inner variable shadows the outer one

14. Illegal shadowing
- Happens when you declare let or const in a scope where var is already declared

15. Call, Apply, Bind
- These are used to explicitly set the this value of a function

call()
- Calls a function immediately with a given this and arguments passed one by one

apply()
- Same as call, arguments are passed in a array

bind()
- Returns a new function with the this context as that of the object. Can call it later

16. Polyfill
- Piece of code that new feature on older browser that doesnt support it

Transpiler
- Converts modern js syntax to older syntax

17. Symbols
- Unique and primitive immutable values
- Created with symbol()
- Not same even with same values

Uses
- To create unique keys that dont clash with other keys

18. Thenable
- An object with then that acts like a promise

Promise is immutable
- If a promise is settled, it cannot be changed

19. Prototype

Prototype chain
- JS object has a hidden property called prototype 
- This points to another object called called its prototype
- When you access a property on an object, js looks in the object
- If not found, js starts looking in the related prototypes

Prototypal inheritance
- Object inherit methods from their prototype

Uses
- Share methods 
- Avoid duplication
- Enable code reuse 

20. Deep and Shallow copy

Shallow Copy
- Copies only the top level 
- If property is a primitive, it value is copied
- If property is an object or array, its reference is copied
- Nested objects or array are shared between the copy and original

Deep Copy
- Copies all levels of object or array recursively
- Nested objects or arrays are brand new, no references shared
- Changes in the copy do not affect original

21. Constructor function

Special type of function used to create and initialize objects
- Starts with a capital letter
- Called using the new keyword

22. Web workers
- Special way to run js in the background
- Seperate from the main browser UI
- Keeps the UI responsive while performing heavy tasks like
